	LODCTR
       		Updates registry values related to performance counters.
		Usage:
       	LODCTR <INI-filename>
             	Installs counter text strings. INI-filename is the name of the
             	initialization file that contains the counter name definitions
             	and explain text for an extensible counter DLL.

       	LODCTR /C:<filename>
             	Upgrades counter text strings using <filename>

       	LODCTR /H:<filename>
             	Upgrades help text strings using <filename>

       	LODCTR /L:<LangID>
             	Specifies the language for the /C and /H commands

       	LODCTR /S:<Backup-filename>
            	Saves the current perf registry strings and info to
             	<Backup-filename>

       	LODCTR /R
             	Rebuilds perf registry from scratch based on current registry
             	settings and backup INI files.

       	LODCTR /R:<filename>
             	Restores perf registry strings & info using <filename>

       	LODCTR /T:<service-name>
             	Sets the specified performance counter provider as trusted.

       	LODCTR /Q
             	Displays performance counter provider information.

       	LODCTR /Q:<service-name>
             	Displays performance counter provider information for a
             	specific provider.

       	LODCTR /E:<service-name>
             	Enables the performance counter provider.

       	LODCTR /D:<service-name>
             	Disables the performance counter provider.

       	LODCTR /M:<Counter-Manifest> [<Installation-Path>]
            	Installs a v2.0 performance counter provider using the specified
             	XML manifest.

             	The installation requires a full path to the DLL containing the
             	performance counter resources (localized  strings). The path
             	to the DLL will be determined as follows:

             	If the applicationIdentity attribute in the manifest is a full
             	path, that will be used.

             	Otherwise, if <Installation-Path> is provided and is a full
             	path, that will be used.

             	Otherwise, if <Counter-Manifest> is a full path, the directory
             	from <Counter-Manifest> will be combined with the DLL name from
             	the applicationIdentity attribute in the manifest.

		Otherwise, the current directory will be combined with the DLL
             	name from the applicationIdentity attribute in the manifest.

		Note: Any arguments with spaces in the names must be enclosed within double
		quotation marks.

4. Arp

Displays and modifies the IP-to-Physical address translation tables used by
address resolution protocol (ARP).

ARP -s inet_addr eth_addr [if_addr]
ARP -d inet_addr [if_addr]
ARP -a [inet_addr] [-N if_addr] [-v]

  -a            Displays current ARP entries by interrogating the current
                protocol data.  If inet_addr is specified, the IP and Physical
                addresses for only the specified computer are displayed.  If
                more than one network interface uses ARP, entries for each ARP
                table are displayed.
  -g            Same as -a.
  -v            Displays current ARP entries in verbose mode.  All invalid
                entries and entries on the loop-back interface will be shown.
  inet_addr     Specifies an internet address.
  -N if_addr    Displays the ARP entries for the network interface specified
                by if_addr.
  -d            Deletes the host specified by inet_addr. inet_addr may be
                wildcarded with * to delete all hosts.
  -s            Adds the host and associates the Internet address inet_addr
                with the Physical address eth_addr.  The Physical address is
                given as 6 hexadecimal bytes separated by hyphens. The entry
                is permanent.
  eth_addr      Specifies a physical address.
  if_addr       If present, this specifies the Internet address of the
                interface whose address translation table should be modified.
                If not present, the first applicable interface will be used.
Example:
  > arp -s 157.55.85.212   00-aa-00-62-c6-09  .... Adds a static entry.
  > arp -a                                    .... Displays the arp table.

C:\Users\LENOVO>ping

Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
            [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
            [-w timeout] [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-c compartment] [-p]
            [-4] [-6] target_name

Options:
    -t             Ping the specified host until stopped.
                   To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
                   To stop - type Control-C.
    -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
    -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
    -l size        Send buffer size.
    -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only).
    -i TTL         Time To Live.
    -v TOS         Type Of Service (IPv4-only. This setting has been deprecated
                   and has no effect on the type of service field in the IP
                   Header).
    -r count       Record route for count hops (IPv4-only).
    -s count       Timestamp for count hops (IPv4-only).
    -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.
    -R             Use routing header to test reverse route also (IPv6-only).
                   Per RFC 5095 the use of this routing header has been
                   deprecated. Some systems may drop echo requests if
                   this header is used.
    -S srcaddr     Source address to use.
    -c compartment Routing compartment identifier.
    -p             Ping a Hyper-V Network Virtualization provider address.

QUERY and QUERYEX OPTIONS:
        If the query command is followed by a service name, the status
        for that service is returned.  Further options do not apply in
        this case.  If the query command is followed by nothing or one of
        the options listed below, the services are enumerated.
    type=    Type of services to enumerate (driver, service, userservice, all)
             (default = service)
    state=   State of services to enumerate (inactive, all)
             (default = active)
    bufsize= The size (in bytes) of the enumeration buffer
             (default = 4096)
    ri=      The resume index number at which to begin the enumeration
             (default = 0)
    group=   Service group to enumerate
             (default = all groups)
